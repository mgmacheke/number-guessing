Concept:
The player guesses a number within a specified range, and the program provides clues based on previous guesses. You store the guesses in an ArrayList and track attempts.

Steps to Implement:

1. Generate a random number between 1 and 100.
2. Allow the user to input guesses.
3. Store each guess in an ArrayList.
4. Provide feedback:
    1. "Higher" or "Lower" based on the guess.
    2. Display previous guesses from the ArrayList.
